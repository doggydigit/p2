NAME
seqalign - global sequence alignment

SYNOPSIS

seqalign SEQ1 SEQ2 [SEQ3,...]

DESCRIPTION

seqalign finds all optimal alignments between the sequences passed.
If more than two sequences are given, the first one is taken as reference and
align-basic searches all optimal alignments between the reference sequence and
the others.

Each input sequence can be either a litteral string or a filename containing the
sequence. In files, the '#' characters indicates a line-oriented comment.

EXAMPLES
(all three examples give the same output)


seqalign AGTC ACT 

echo AGTC > seq; seqalign seq ACT

echo AGTC > seq1; echo ACT > seq2; seqalign seq1 seq2
